## Technical Details

### 1. Debug System Architecture
```javascript
const debugUtils = {
  error: (category, message, data) => log(3, category, message, data),
  warn: (category, message, data) => log(2, category, message, data),
  info: (category, message, data) => log(1, category, message, data),
  debug: (category, message, data) => log(0, category, message, data)
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Validation
- Added parameter validation before API calls
- Implemented input sanitization
- Added type checking for critical functions
